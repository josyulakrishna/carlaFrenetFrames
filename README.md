# Carla Frenet Frame Obstacle Avoidance and NMPC/PID Trajectory tracking 


Frenet-trajectory generation is done using the [PythonRobotics](https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics) library, The vehicle simulated is a Tesla Model 3, The trajectories are dynamically generated for every 200 meters. 

Highlights 
- Frenet Trajectory Generation in Carla(0.9.13) 
- PID controller for trajectory tracking 
- Dynamic and Static Obstacle Avoidance 
- Collision free trajectories in presence of traffic
- Lane Change, Lane Merge and Intersection Management with Frenet Frames
